# Injected Tests

## What is Injected Tests?

Injected Tests is a test framework agnostic helper for simple test set-up using dependency injection.
It is designed to simplify component and integration tests by offering an uniform API for configuring and initializing your component(s) under test.
It is also designed to be adopted into an existing test suite in small incremental steps.

## Why should I use Injected Tests?

The following is easier with Injected Tests:

* Using dependency injection to wire the component under test
* Mocking injected dependencies
* Sharing configuration and initialization logic between tests
* Disposing resources
